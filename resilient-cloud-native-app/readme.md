## Project Setup
> Pre-req: Requires JDK 8 or higher installed on the host

1) Clone and open a command prompt on project's root dir.

2) Type: `mvn spring-boot:run`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the pom.xml file.
    
3) Test with Curl: `curl -XPOST 'localhost:8080/api/v1/invoices?accountId=2&orderId=1'`
    This calls the REST API to create an invoice object.
