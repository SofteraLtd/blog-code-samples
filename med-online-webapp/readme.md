## Project Setup
> Pre-req: Requires Elasticsearch to source data, see [sample data loading project](/med-online-data-load) to help prepare, load test data for this example.

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (med-online-webapp)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
